# Components

## Interactables 💬
Make items do things in your game. Open a chest, unlock a door, spawn an enemy or story event.
Flip a switch, pull a lever, stand on a button.

## Enemy AI 🤖
Make your enemies do more than stand and shoot. Can they respond to the terrain or to the characters actions?

## Better physics and motion 🏃‍♂️
Get forces, torqures, mass and moment of inertia correctly working with the pymunk library

## Shaders 🎨
Build on the basics of shaders with fantastic looking explosions, lasers and cone-of-vision components

## Natural movement / Steering behavior / Seek / Follow / Avoid 🚶‍♀️
Get your enemies to move more naturally, seeking the player and even predicting the players movements
Set up evading and pathfollowing, and even swarming enemies.

## Menu Systems / Inventory 📋
select options in a menu with sprites and the arcade-GUI library

## Text Systems / Dialogue 💬
Use the arcade GUI library to deliver text throughout your game

## Narration / Event Driven Audio 🎤🎶
Play and stop audio on events

## Cutscenes 🎬
Play vidoes within an arcade game

## Stat Driven Characters 📈
How to make players or enemies more engaging with RPG like components
Using stats, experience and leveling

## Weapon Swapping 🔫
How to deal with multiple options in a game like attacking with one of many options of weapos

## Consumable Items 🍔
How do we make sure consumables are fun, engaging, and implimented correctly?

## Checkpoints 🏁
Return from whence you came.

## Local Multiplayer 🕹️
Hard. Might not be possible in your context. Think hard about if this is crucial to your game, or a nice to have.

## Online Multiplayer - Hardmode 🌐🔥
Very hard. Websockets, remote servers. Probably authentication. Firebase. We might be writing node. 

## Users 👥
Save info about your users to a file. Make sure it's safe. Load it up again.

## Save Games 💾
Save your users games. Allowing for a much longer multi-session experience.

## Better Music for Non-Musicians 🎶💻
Write music using code with sonic-pi. 
Learn a bit of ruby along the way.

## Current Gen AI Asset Creation 🤖🎮
Use AI to make your art

## Better Animation Methods 🎥
Make nicer animations with this one weird trick.

## Proceduaral Terrain Generation
Randomly make your maps each time. Every playthrough is unique. 

## Destructable terrain
Blow up some land. Dig, bore and shovel.
